                <p> This is the beginning to my software engineering journey. I decided to study software engineering because I am very interested in coding. I find it really fun, and there is so much cool stuff that you can do when you are writing with these computer programming languages. When I was extremely young, I thought that computers were a bit frustrating and annoying. However, as I grew older I began to understanding that technology was becoming and essential part of our daily lives, and it can actually have a positive impact on the world. Some of my former classmates who had studied different degrees decided to become programmers, and I also had a few relatives who went into IT and programming. </p>
                <p>In this first project with Academy Xi, we were asked to design a website using the skills we learned within the first week. I used mainly CSS and HTML for the website. The theme for the website was environment and sustainability. I enjoyed exploring different layouts and backgrounds for my website that would match the theme. I learned that not only are there many ways to achieve the same result in web development, but sometimes, there is no "quick fix" in web development and there is no "one size fits all". Furthermore, just slightly different formatting in code can completely change your website layout. Sometimes you might know the formula in CSS for printing something a certain way, but it only works if you format your HTML a specific way. My second learning is that web developers are constantly learning and constantly googling. StackOverflow, W3 Schools tutorials, and W3 Schools Markup Validation Service are very useful resources. Unlike other disciplines, web development seems like a constantly evolving field.</p>
                <p>What went well in this project was that I was able to get the navigation bar, pictures, links, and content up, mostly the way I wanted it to, and I was able to put make the corners of the content boxes blur a bit. However, there were also some troubles that I ran along the way. For example, initially I was not able to fit everything well on the same webpage, but afterwards I took some advice and this was fixed with the "@media screen and (min-width: 650px)" function in CSS. Also, sometimes once the CSS came with an unexpected error and I was a bit flustered because all the text was flowing out of the box which it was supposed to be contained in, but it seemed that adding a break or repositioning some lines of code seemed to do the trick. Therefore, it seems like web development is also a constant experimentation process. It is also a constant collaboration process as people help eachother out with code, whether through StackOverflow, OpenSource, or face-to-face.</p>
                <p>A gist of my web development process was as follows: (1) Have a layout in mind, (2) Find out how to achieve that layout, (3) Structure the HTML document according to that layout, (4) Try to structure the CSS to achieve that layout, (5) View how the webpage looks with this CSS code (6) Repeat steps (4) and (5) until desired look of the page has been achieved, and (7) Make any fixes and adjustments to HTML and CSS document.</p>
